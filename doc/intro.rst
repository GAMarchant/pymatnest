Overview of nested sampling
-------------------------------------

First introduced by John Skilling [ref], Nested Sampling became a powerful method
to uniformly sample atomic configuartion spaces, calculate the partition function and thermodynamic quantities.
A tool to calculate phase diagrams in an automated way with no prior knowledge of the phases.

The algorithm
-------------------------------------

Nested sampling is an iterative method...
Size of live set, random walk...etc.


``pymatnest``
-------------------------------------

The ``pymatnest`` package is a software
library written in Fortran 95/python for the purposes of carrying out
nested sampling calculations. It can be used with

   - the in-built fortran models

   - ``QUIP``

   - ``LAMMPS``
