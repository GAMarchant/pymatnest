1. Make atom MC step size commensurate with cell size. Possibly change to doing atom MC steps in fractional coordinates.
2. Automatically adjust initial step sizes to within the acceptance tolerances used throughout the calculation.
3. Update stepsize setting routine so that it fixes the stepsize within certain tolerances. Routine should perform a small amount of additional exploration, starting from random configurations stored on each process. This will help to avoid "pan handle" problems.
