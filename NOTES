find N_c top E
pick floor(N_c/P) on each node + N_c%P globally to be cloned
sendrecv / eliminate max E, replace with clone(s)
   walk same number on each node = max(number of cloned per node)
      walk: multiple iterations of:
	 randomize cell
	 randomize vel (dep on new PE from new cell)
	 propagate MD
